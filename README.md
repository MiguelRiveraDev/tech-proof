## Project Overview

This project is a proof of concept (POC) for a NestJS application using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture. The goal is to demonstrate how these architectural patterns can be applied to create a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:holaunibo/tech-proof.git
cd tech-proof
npm install
```

## Code Review and Pull Request

As part of the development process, a code review should be conducted. Follow these steps:

1. Review the codebase and identify areas for improvement.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Implement the proposed changes.
4. Create a Pull Request (PR) with a detailed description of the changes.

## Meeting to Discuss Changes

Once the PR is created, a meeting will be scheduled to discuss the proposed changes. During the meeting, the following points will be covered:

- Explanation of the changes made.
- Reasons for the changes.
- Impact on the overall architecture and codebase.
- Any potential issues or concerns.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a demonstration of how to apply DDD and Hexagonal Architecture in a NestJS application. By following the steps outlined above, we can ensure a thorough review process and maintain a high-quality codebase.
